# portfolio
This is my first online portfolio. I made this for school, but I also uploaded it on github, so anyone can see it.

View page here: Cezar-22/github.io/portfolio
The repository is public.
If you have issues or pull requests, you can definely leave them here. I will see them and try to fix them.
